# Repo of neural networks in nuclear physics

## How it works
This repo are the calculations for the neural networks created in my bachelor's thesis. It has a notebook which contains gridsearch, which contains all the necessary tools to perform a grdi search and plot the results. This is the summary of my bachelor's thesis. 

## Activating conda environment

To use the conda environment in Linux, after installing miniconda and adding it to the path run the following command on the repository folder
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This will create the environment with the necessary dependencies. Then run the following:
```
source ~/.bashrc
conda activate myenv
```

## Future updates not started
